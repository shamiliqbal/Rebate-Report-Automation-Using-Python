# Rebate-Report-Automation-Using-Python

I'm excited to share a recent project where I automated the generation of rebate reports for car manufacturers using Python. This solution integrates data from three key sources:

Rebate Files: Containing rebate amounts and their valid date intervals.

Purchase Records: Detailing quantities purchased and corresponding dates.

Sales Data: Documenting quantities sold and purchase dates by customers.‚Äã

üîç Key Features:

Data Integration: Merged and aligned datasets based on car types and manufacturers.

Rebate Calculation: Applied business logic to compute rebates for each car type, considering whether the rebate is based on purchases or sales.

Automation: Streamlined the entire process, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

Reporting: Generated formatted reports using Python's DataFrame capabilities, presenting both total and segmented rebate information.‚Äã

This automation not only enhances efficiency but also ensures accuracy in rebate calculations, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
